# <h2>Who am I?</h2>

I am John, I am a third year student studying a BSc (Honours) Computing degree at National College of Ireland. I worked for years as an assistant director in the film industry, but the industry fell apart in the mid to late noughties. I struggle to find direction/career in life until I came back to Ireland for family reasons and I did a manual software testing cert course. Whilst there, my lecturer introduced us to basic programming. And I must admit I loved it, I loved the challenge of getting my head around object orientated programming. It felt like the ultimate crossword puzzle for challenging the brain.

 I have been working again in the film industry mostly on Vikings but now in the locations department. This has been ideal as its summer seasonal work for a student who needs a job in the summer, but I will not make the same mistake again i.e. work an industry that can evaporate and I would be left unemployed.
 
 

# <h2>Interests</h2>

# Motorbikes and Country walks
I own a couple of motorbikes. I find nothing clears the head like a motorbike ride. I either head up the Wicklow mountains on the bike for a walk in the beautiful garden of Ireland or I have loads of family in Co Clare. I head down to Clare on the motorbike and stay with family. Its such a lovely change to the big city.

# History
I am obsessed by history. I read books on historical figures, major historical events and important wars and battles. I also watch copious amounts of documentaries on those subjects.

# Future Goals
* When qualified with a degree, I would also like to add Comptia security+ to my resume and along with other cyber security certificates.
* Work in the industry in Cyber security.
* Spend the rest of my life expanding my knowledge of information technology and History.
